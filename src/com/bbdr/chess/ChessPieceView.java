    // This table contains a list of overloaded constructors.

    // features such as the UI designer will make use of the other overloads
    // such as View(Context, AttributeSet).
    //
    // 3. Don't implement constructors if the target SDK does not implement the
    // corresponding View constructor.
    //
    // 4. Check ChessBoardView.java if you need to; it is an example of a custom View
    // and implements the same constructors that are required.
